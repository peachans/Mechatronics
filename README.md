# Mechatronics
This project is one of the project under Mechatronics course at Chulalongkorn university. The code was implemented in rasberrypi 4, and used gpiozero library to control the GPIO. It use camera to detect the location of the, and used it to control the water system which in this case is wind, water and soap. We used solenoid to control the flow of the fluid.
